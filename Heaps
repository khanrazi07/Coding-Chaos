# 🔷 Heap & Priority Queue

This folder contains my implementations and practice problems related to **Heaps** and **Priority Queues**, which are fundamental data structures used for efficient priority-based operations.

---

## 📌 Concepts Covered

- Binary Heap (Max Heap & Min Heap)
- Complete Binary Tree representation using arrays
- Heapify Algorithm (Top-down / Sift Down)
- Heap Insertion (Sift Up)
- Heap Deletion (Extraction)
- Priority Queue implementation
- K-th Largest Element using Heap

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- A heap is a **complete binary tree** that satisfies the heap property.
- Max Heap: Parent ≥ Children  
- Min Heap: Parent ≤ Children
- Heapify is applied starting from the **last non-leaf node (n/2 − 1)**.
- Priority Queues are implemented internally using heaps.
- For k-th largest problems:
  - Max Heap → extract k−1 times
  - Min Heap → maintain heap of size k (optimal)
